Kiss The Sky is a browser-based indie video game. Players can either compete to breed a flower that reaches the sky, or let ambient mode play out for hours or days or weeks.\n\n<br><br> &bull;\nA bata version will be relased soon. But, visit the our <a href=\"https://codepen.io/robbobfrh84/pen/KjJxja\">codepen</a> to play a demo of the game. \n\n<br><br> &bull;\nEvery year, flowers bloom and bear seeds that carry a combination of their own genes and the genes of the flowers that pollinated them. In spring, seedlings sprout and compete for the sunlight they need to grow. New plants with genes for the broadest leaves and the tallest, strongest stalks thrive. The rest whither or topple over to die in the shadows. When summer arrives, healthy plants bloom flowers whose colors are determined by the most dominant genes they carry for petal hue and brightness. But things are always changing. No year is quite like the last. With every new generation, a few genes mutate to produce new traits that have never existed before, and that may change the species forever.\n\n<br><br> &bull;\nYour goal is to breed a bright red flower that reaches all the way to the sky. Tap or swipe to eliminate any unwanted plants; leave only plants with genes that might produce the tallest stalks and the reddest flowers in the next generation. When there are no red flowers, keep plants with flowers whose colors are closest to a bright red color. Then watch for mutations of hue and brightness until you've yielded a beautiful red bloom. Keep plants with the strongest stalks, even if they're short. Keep plants with the tallest stalks, even if they're weak. Don't forget to keep some plants with the broadest leaves as well. When your population cross-pollinates to yield a new leafy plant with a tall, strong stalk, eliminate the rest and let the new species propagate until new mutations arise yet again."

I built this pen out to be a background to a portfolio site. Nothin' that makes too much sense ... just like driving a spaceship in warp drive!\n\n<br><br> &bull;\nOne really unexpected and neat thing was adding the gradients to lines, then setting it with a \"round\"-ed end. Once I made the lines essentially a square, the rounded end and gradient gave it a cool \"crescent\"-like effect.

If it wasn&rsquo;t obvious with a few other projects I&rsquo;ve created and worked on - I like grids and pixels. I&rsquo;m a horrible free-hand artist so when it&rsquo;s simplified and as mathematic as possible, it makes it hard for other artists to know I&rsquo;m a sham!\n      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So here, on this site we have an 8-by-8 grid constrained to 16 colors, one being transparent. This project currently stands alone for a user to create pixel art and save it to the public gallery.</p>\n      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Also, as an experiment with PubNub&rsquo;s global data-stream network, I decided to stretch their service&rsquo;s legs and create a global pixel-chat function that allows anyone around to world to simultaneously create pixel-art on the same grid. Hypothetically there could be more artists than pixels!</p>\n      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The video on the slideshow above demonstrates how two star-crossed lovers could work on a pixel heart together - at the same time &ndash; from opposite sides of the planet &ndash; in a pre-framed portrait.</p>\n      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I plan to add several functions to the site, but as of now, the sites is still a 100% front-end application with all shared data stored and retrieved as JSON files from PubNub. A Node.js backend is on its way and will bring with it additional capabilities such as user log in, editing, deleting and sharing of pixel art. Also, a SUPER Ayte-by8 - also called and Ayte-by8-by8-by8, or 64-by-64 editor is on its way!</p>\n      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, I have built an 8-by-8 pixel display frame with the CNC router (see: CNC microcontrollers for project info) as well as implementation the new MKR1000, Arduino&rsquo;s new IoT WiFi capable microcontroller.</p>\n      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; WARNING: your art will be framed and displayed in my living room upon sharing to the public gallery or editing the live pixel-chat. The framed pixel display is programmed in C++ and continuously check for new updates to the website. If a new Ayte-by8 is shared the image will display on the frame! So, what are you waiting for! Let me see your art.</p>\n      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t believe me or want to see what you art looked like in my living room, send me an email and I&rsquo;ll put it back up and take a picture and send it to you!</p>"
